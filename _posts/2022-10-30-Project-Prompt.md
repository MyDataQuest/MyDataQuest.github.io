## Description:
This case study is a capstone project that I completed in October 2022 as part of the Google Data Anlytics Professional Certificate program that I undertook via Coursera. This capstone project allows for an open ended approach to analyze the data that is provided, using the different tools and skills that we learnt in the professional certificate program. I’ve included the case study brief and the company profile below, along with a short summary.   

## TLDR: 
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company based in Chicago that services the city with 5,824 geotracked bicycles available for rent and a network of 692 stations across the city.  The marketing team were asked to design marketing strategies aimed to convert casual riders into annual members. As a junior data analyst in the marketing team, my task is to answer the question **“How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?”.** Public data regarding Cyclistic’s rides history for the past 12 months were provided. 

## Case Study Brief
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## About Cyclistic:
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. 
Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends. Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
