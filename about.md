Hello! My name is Joshua Hasan and I'm an aspiring data analyst living in Austin,TX!

My previous work experience entails 4.5 years with Accenture where I spent most of my time as a reporting analyst. In this position, I streamlined reports, maintained operational dashboards and crafted presentation decks backed with operational data, statistics and insights to support our client's weekly touchpoint. I also held a short position as a Senior Business Analyst at AMD. 

After resigning from my position at AMD, I wanted to upgrade my career from a reporting analyst to a data analyst. Therefore I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This certification program had thought me alot about Data cleaning & analysis, crafting data viz and writing queries in SQL. It also empowered me to make this site to showcase my portfolio projects to potential employers and peers in the certificate program.

Let's connect on [***LinkedIn***](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuahasan/), Currently I'm open to work and I'm actively searching for roles in the capacities of a (Associate to Mid level) Data Analyst or Business Analyst.   

Outside of work and data analytics, I enjoy playing boardgames in my local boardgame cafe and collecting Legos (starwars specifically). I also love traveling to explore new places and their delicacies!
